This repository provides the code accopinying the exploration of DNNs discussed in the pdf titled: Deep Learning Surrogate models for
Differential Equations.

The folders are orginised as follows:

Testing DNNs - contains implimentation of DNNs without importing any Deep learning based packages

Pytorch for DNN - contains scripts leveraging the pytorch package for testing DNNs and solving some ODEs

PDEs - contains scripts exploring the use of the FEniCSx package for simulating training data for training DNNs on a variety of PDEs
